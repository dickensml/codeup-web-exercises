    /**
    * TODO:
    * Suppose there's a promotion in Walmart, each customer is given a randomly
    * generated "lucky number" between 0 and 5. If your lucky number is 0 you have
    * no discount, if your lucky number is 1 you'll get a 10% discount, if it's 2,
    * the discount is 25%, if it's 3, 35%, if it's 4, 50%, and if it's 5 you'll get
    * everything for free!.
    *
    * Write a function named `calculateTotal` which accepts a lucky number and total
    * amount, and returns the discounted price.
    *
    * Example:
    * calculateTotal(0, 100) // returns 100
    * calculateTotal(4, 100) // returns 50
    * calculateTotal(5, 100) // returns 0
    *
    * Test your function by passing it various values and checking for the expected
    * return value.
